# NOAA Minimal API Space Facts

## Introduction

## Installation:

## Docker

## TODO
* Setup dynamic route for single entries
* Setup docker container
* Build dedicated satellite add page
* Add dedicated page for listing all satellites in db
* Think about ACID principles with the api endpoints, i.e., what do happens if you are in the middle of a  
transaction and a separate thread changes the information you are working on before you get to it?

* Bug when adding empty satellite entry increments database id
* Add PUT request endpoint

* Add new endpoints from separate database that holds data from an ETL process
